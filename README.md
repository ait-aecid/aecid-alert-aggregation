# aecid-alert-aggregation
A method for grouping, clustering, and merging semi-structured alerts.

Please note that the following dependencies must be installed to run the code:
```
pip3 install cdifflib
pip3 install editdistance
```

To get started, just clone this repository and execute
```
python3 aggregate.py
```
to run the aecid-alert-aggregation with the default input files and configurations. To change the configuration, edit the aggregate_config.py file. The input files provided in this repository are alerts generated by [aminer](https://github.com/ait-aecid/logdata-anomaly-miner) and [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) IDS that were used to analyze the [AIT-LDSv1.1](https://zenodo.org/record/4264796#.X7vQTFAxnmE).

When running the python script, the current status of the aggregation is printed on console. In its standard configuration, the script runs for several minutes and then outputs the generated meta-alerts in the directory specified in the configuration file. The output should look as follows:

Results:
 delta = 0.5: 41 meta-alerts generated
 delta = 5: 15 meta-alerts generated

Meta-alerts are stored in data/out/aggregate/meta_alerts.txt

Alerts are stored in data/out/aggregate/alerts.txt
```

Each line of output corresponds to a group of alerts that occur in close temporal proximity. For each group, the attack phase and group size (i.e., number of alerts in the group) are printed. Moreover, the output indicates whether a group is added to an already existing meta-alert (including the similarity between the group and the meta-alert as well as the attack phase represented by the meta-alert) or whether a new meta-alert is generated. As stated at the end of the output, 41 meta-alerts were generated for a time delta of 0.5 seconds and 15 meta-alerts were generated for a time delta of 5 seconds (use parameter `deltas` in the `agggregate_config.py` file to specify the time deltas).

The directory 'samples' contains several examples that are useful for understanding the aggregation technique. The samples include:
* sample_similarity.py similarities of sample alerts
* sample_group_similarity.py similarities of sample alert groups
* sample_merge.py aggregation of sample alerts
* sample_group_merge.py aggregation of sample alert groups
* sample_hierarchical_clustering.py execution of the hierarchical clustering method on sample data
* sample.py execution of incremental meta-alert generation on sample data (corresponds to scenario 2 in paper)

The directory 'evaluation' contains several scripts that measure the performance of the approach. Note that the respective configurations are inside the scripts instead of the aggregate_config.py file. Evaluation scripts include:
* mds.py generates a similarity matrix for multi-dimensional scaling
* hierarchical_clustering.py generates an R script for plotting a dendrogram
* evaluate.py uses unsupervised clustering for meta-alert generation
* cross_validation.py uses supervised training for alert classification
* noise_evaluate.py measures the robustness of the approach

Copy any of the sample and evaluation scripts into the main directory to execute it, e.g.:
```
cp samples/sample.py ./sample.py
python3 sample.py
```

The output will be generated on the console or in the respective directory in data/out.
